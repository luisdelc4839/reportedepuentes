# Border Crossing Wait Times | El Paso / Ciudad Juárez

## Live Border Crossing Data with Integrated Camera Feeds

## Overview
This project provides real-time updates on border crossing wait times for El Paso, TX - Ciudad Juárez, MX crossings. It integrates:

- Vehicle and pedestrian wait times sourced from the official API.
- Live camera feeds directly embedded for each bridge.
- A user-friendly UI with responsive design and smooth animations.

Unlike many open-source projects, most of the development and commits were done locally, making this a true passion project with a focus on real-world usability rather than just online presence.

## Key Features
